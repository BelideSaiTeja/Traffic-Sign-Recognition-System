# Traffic Sign Recognition Deep Learning Project

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on Traffic Sign Recognition. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system that can automatically recognize and classify traffic signs from images. This has important applications in real-world scenarios, such as self-driving cars, advanced driver assistance systems, and traffic management.

# Introduction
Traffic sign recognition is a crucial task for ensuring road safety and efficient traffic management. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features and complex rule-based systems. However, with the advent of deep learning, we can develop data-driven approaches that can automatically learn and extract relevant features for traffic sign recognition.

In this project, we utilize deep learning techniques to build a robust traffic sign recognition system. We explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks. The model is trained on a large dataset of annotated traffic sign images, allowing it to learn the distinctive features of different signs.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign), which consists of thousands of labeled images across 43 different classes of traffic signs. The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set, enabling us to train our model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another.

# Future Enhancements
While our current model performs well, there are several avenues for improvement:

**Data Augmentation:** Implement additional data augmentation techniques to increase model robustness.
**Model Ensembling:** Combine multiple models to improve overall performance.
**Real-world Testing:** Evaluate the model on real-world images and video streams.
